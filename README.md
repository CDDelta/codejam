# Google Code Jam Entries

These are my attempts at the Google Code Jam challenge.

* [2020](./tree/master/2020)

## Trying solutions
In VSCode, run the `Watch Solution` task and give it the directory to the solution you want to run eg. `2019/foregone-solution`.

To do this without VSCode, enter the directory of a solution from a shell and run `rollup src/solution.ts -w -c ../../rollup.config.js --dir lib`.
